# InfixToPostfix

I have used Stack ADT (abstract data type) to create the program for
infixtoPostfix calculator which will take expression input from the user and scan the
expression from the left to right, when a left parenthesis is encountered, the position is then
added to the stack. and when a right parenthesis is encountered the matching parenthesis is
then removed from the stack.
